</div>
            <p>The Green Door began as a small, community-driven initiative in Ottawa with a simple mission: to serve wholesome, plant-based meals rooted in sustainability, ethics, and care. Founded by a group of passionate food lovers and environmental advocates, the restaurant opened its doors with a commitment to sourcing local, organic ingredients and preparing meals that nourish both body and planet.
                Over the years, The Green Door grew into a beloved gathering place for those seeking conscious dining—welcoming yoga practitioners, students, families, and eco-conscious eaters alike. Its name symbolizes both a literal entry into a green, sustainable space and a metaphorical gateway to mindful living.
                With a focus on transparency, comfort, and culinary excellence, The Green Door continues to evolve while staying true to its roots: delivering food that’s good for people and the planet, without compromising on flavor or integrity.</p>
